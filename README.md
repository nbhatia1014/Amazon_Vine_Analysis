## Overview:

### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to assist Jennefir by analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. The Amazon Vine program is a service that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their products. Companies like SellBy pay a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members, who are then required to publish a review. We will use PySpark to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine Members.
